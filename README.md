**The goal of this project is to create a neural network in the context of the cosmological-polytope of a graph.**

**More precisly we want to reininforce the network in a way that it ideally outputs a $h^*$-polynomial of cosmological-polytope, which has non-unimodular sequence of coefficients.**

**The game we want to play is, starting with the empty graph, to decide in each step whether to take the next edge or not.**

**Moreover after a game is finished we only take the graph if it's connected.**
